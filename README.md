# Loan-Predicition
The Loan Prediction dataset from Kaggle contains 614 loan applications with 13 features, including gender, marital status, income, loan amount, credit history, and loan status. The objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on the other features in the dataset.
